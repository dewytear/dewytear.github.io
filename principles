            <h2>Principles</h2>
            <p>

                There were five primary goals in the creation of the Java language:
                <ul>
                    <li>It must be simple, object-oriented, and familiar.</li>
                    <li>It must be robust and secure.</li>
                    <li>It must be architecture-neutral and portable.</li>
                    <li>It must execute with high performance.</li>
                    <li>It must be interpreted, threaded, and dynamic.</li>
                </ul>
